    "text": "Q2: How to define a successful pathogen?\nA2:\n\nAlthough the definition of a successful pathogen can be uncertain and controversial, in recent years, this term has been used to define those microorganisms that manage to establish a successful relationship with their host, which guarantees its transmissibility and its permanence on Earth. Thus, the ability of a microorganism to rapidly adapt to changes in the microenvironment through the deployment of specialized strategies, and survive within its host despite the deadly attack of the innate and adaptive immune response seems to be the key leading to evolutionary success.\n\n\nC. glabrata (光滑念珠菌，真菌) is a successful pathogen and an artist manipulating the immune response like M. tuberculosis (结核分枝杆菌，细菌).\n\nMicrobiol Res. 2022. PMID: 35430489\nThen, how to define a successful person?"

But it works the other way too: there’s also a lot that’s possible with ImageJ, but which isn’t possible with QuPath alone.\n\n\nFortunately, you don’t have to choose one or the other. They are both open and can be used together.\n\nQuPath"

    "text": "Q7: How do we know we can trust the bioimage analysis results?\nA7:\n\nExcellent question - stay skeptical!\n\n\nImage analysis lets you generate numbers, but these can be sensitive to how precisely you do the analysis (with or without machine learning). QuPath gives you the tools to make the measurements and to visualize them, but the meaning and validation is up to the user.\n\n\nThis is why image analysis results (from any software) should be carefully validated and treated with caution. Doing this is challenging because the ‘truth’ can be hard to define. One way is to compare with expert evaluation. Another (in some cases) is to use clinical outcome. Both these have limitations; validation is almost always hard – but crucial.\n\n\nThere is also the possibility of bugs in any software. If you find any discrepancies, please report them so they can be investigated and fixed if necessary.\n\nQuPath"

    "text": "Q8: What is the relationship between image analysis & objectivity?\nA8:\n\nOne of the claimed advantages of image analysis over visual assessment is that it is objective.\n\n\nI hope this tutorials helps demonstrate why this is completely wrong!\n\n\nEven for this very simple example, we need to make decisions:\n\n\n\nAt what resolution will we perform our detection?\nWhat should be included in the tissue? Do we want areas of fat or not?\nHow to we define our stain colors?\nWhat thresholds do we use?\n\n\n\nAll of these can impact the results. Different people may (subjectively) make different decisions, and the results of their analysis will differ accordingly.\n\n\nQuPath does not answer these questions for you, but gives you the tools for you to construct your own analysis pipelines.\n\n\nHowever, while it is important to be aware that image analysis is not objective, this does not make it useless. Used cautiously – and with careful validation – image analysis may be faster, more reproducible, and more quantitative than visual assessment.\n\nQuPath"
